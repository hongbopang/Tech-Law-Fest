          - Section 13, which requires consent to be given before personal data is collected, used or disclosed.<br>
         - Section 14, which explicitly states that consent that is obtained without first notifying the individual of the purpose(s) is not valid consent, nor is the consent valid if false, misleading or deceptive practices have been utilized.<br>
         - Section 46, which prohibits an organization from requiring an individual to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service to that individual.</td>
        <td>Yes<br>
          - Section 32, which requires that consent be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.<br></td>

      <tr>
        <td>Deemed Consent</td>

        <td>No<br>

         - Section 17(2) and s 17(3) similarly provides that personal data can be used and disclosed without consent in the circumstances set out in the Third and Fourth Schedules respectively.<br>
         - Examples include if the personal data is publicly available, if the use is necessary for evaluative purposes, or if the personal data is collected solely for artistic or literary purposes.</td>
        <td>No<br>
          - Article 7, which stipulates that where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data.<br>

        <td>Yes<br>

      <tr>
        <td>Accuracy and Completeness Obligation</td>
        <td>Not stated<br>
          - Section 23, which stipulates that organizations make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal data collected by or on behalf of the organization is accurate and complete. However, this “reasonable effort” required is not an absolute requirement as organizations are only required to do this if the personal data is likely to be used by the organization to make a decision that affects the individual to whom the personal data relates or if it is likely to be disclosed by the organization to another organization.</td>
